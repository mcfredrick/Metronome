This is as simple as can be right now. Just start/stop and a slider for BPM. I have big plans for this one. So, stay tuned.

If you want to dig into the code, I recommend downloading JUCE if you don't have it already and opening the .jucer file to get started. Alternatively, you could open up the .sln file in Visual Studio if you're into that sort of thing.
